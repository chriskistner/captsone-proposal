Chris Kistner Galvanize Capstone Proposals

###### AirWaves.com #####

My primary proposal is to create a website for people with asthma and allergies so they can can track pollen and air quality along routes and points of interest. Users will be able to create an account and then save both locations and routes using Google Maps to their account. The site will then query the breezeometer API for daily air quality reports and pollen counts to get up to date information about the conditions along their route. Thid will help inform active users whether they should bike that day or drive, take allergy medications or perhaps work from home. Users will also be able to create alerts and get an email with a report on a selected route or locations air quality sent to them. 

Technologies Used: Google Maps API, Breezeometer Pollen API & Air Quality API, Javascript ES6, React-Redux, Axiois, Postrgresql, Express. Nodemailer        


##### ApexGameSales.com #####
Secondary proposal, create a site that allows users to create a catalog of their rare videogames and pulls sales/pricing metrics from Ebay APIs. User's will be able to add games and compare the price they bought the game to it's current average sale price on Ebay, then set an alert to be notified when the price reaches a certain level. Users will also be able to contact and make offers on other users games. Would off users a more in depth look  at the appreciation value of their games and help them gauge the best time to sell.
